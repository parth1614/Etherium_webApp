# Etherium_WebApp
BlockChain Multi-functional web app powered by ethereum smart contracts.

We need to have MetaMask browser extension which will help us contact with the ethereum blockchain 
Use Ganache as the default blockchain creation tool

The web app will use "X" amount of ethereum gas/currency to create/delete a task everytime, this opens a wide array of experiments that can be done using the app and it actually opens opportunities to create a unique web app

To start up the project, run the following command on the Terminal: npm run dev
